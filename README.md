2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis.
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using graphs and visualizations.
4. Applied **K-Means Clustering Algorithm** to group customers into clusters.
5. Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
6. Visualized the resulting clusters to understand customer segments better.
7. Drew conclusions about customer groups and their shopping behavior.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
